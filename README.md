<!-- Overview -->
<h2 align="center">Overview</h2>

<p align="center">The project aims to implement an Automatic Video Assistant Referee (VAR) system in soccer matches to improve decision-making accuracy and fairness. It utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for player, ball, and field detection, enabling automatic match management.</p>

<!-- How It Works -->
<h2 align="center">How It Works</h2>

<p align="center">The system employs deep learning techniques for real-time analysis of soccer matches. It detects players, the ball, and key events such as offside and goal situations. The implementation integrates state-of-the-art algorithms like YOLO (You Only Look Once) for efficient object detection.</p>
